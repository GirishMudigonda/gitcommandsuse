->The initial command to run is git fetch for getting the latest updates of your repository.

git fetch

-> Then, you need to git rebase (suppose, the name of remote is origin, which is by default).

The git rebase command will bring the latest commits of master to your branch.

git rebase origin/master

-> Switch to the master branch by running git checkout:

git checkout master


->Get the latest changes from master by using git pull:

git pull origin master

->Then merge the changes with the git merge command:

git merge test

->The final step is pushing local changes to the remote repository :

git push origin master
